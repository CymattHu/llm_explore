# Introduction
This repository leverages Gemini as a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate bounding boxes for queried objects. By integrating LightGlue for feature matching, it provides more accurate and robust results.

Additionally, it includes a database creation utility that builds a local knowledge base to serve as the system prompt, further enhancing Gemini's performance and contextual understanding.
